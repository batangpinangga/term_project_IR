What is automatic music mood classification?
	- task of predicting moods of songs (e.g. happy, sad, upbeat, depressed, angry)
	- moods are often called tags
	- Example: which mood is the song ".... " by the artist "..."
	
Classification based on lyrics
	- in this paper: lyrics used to classify
	- Overview of the classification
				
From a dataset to the mood classification
	- based on a large dataset train system
	- represent songs as vectors si in Vector Space Model s = (t1,t2,.....tn)
	- compute different weighting schemes (binary, td-idf, BM25, delta tf-idf...)
	- classify songs with linear classifers
	- evaluate System (Accuracy-Metric, Kruskal-Wallis test)

Dataset
	- large, free-available Dataset (1mio songs)
	- MSD (Million Songs dataset) and subsets with metadata (LastFM, MusixMatch)
	- comes as json-files or SQLite-Databases
	- contains test and training-files
	- multilangual, only consider English songs

Vector Space Model
	- recap: every song is a vector, every term is a number (tf-value, tdidf-value, 1/0, BM25 or delta tf-idf)
	- 1/0
		binary classifier: 	1=> lyric of this song contain term, 
							0=> lyric of this song doesn't contain term
	- BM25
		[Büsra...your turn :)]
	- delta tf-idf
		[Büsra...your turn :)]

Analysing the Vector Space
	- important for classification performance
	- analysing distribution of songs in training set
	- analysing the classes and the distribution between classes
		- number of songs in 1 class
		- number of distinct terms per class
		- number of unique term per class (which are not in other classes)
		- Mean (std. dev.) number of distinct terms per song
		- Mean (std. dev.) number of terms per song
Classes
	- 3 granularities 
		- tags, groups, quadrants
		-[picture: table 1]
	- Results of analysis
		-[picture: table 2]
	- conclusion: 
		- [picture: table 3]
		- [picture: figure 1]
		- [picture: figure 2] 
		- majority of terms (98%) occur just once in songs, only 1.1% of terms occur twice
			=> no difference in classification result for binary and tf-weighting
		- df histogram follows a long tail distribution: most terms in small subset(1,044 terms (23%) appear in 20 songs) or less, 272 terms (6%) appear in more than 2000 (out of a total of 32,302) songs
		- distribution of terms across documents limits idf-weighting => td-idf, delta-idf, BM25
		- BUT, delta-idf doesn't affect classification much
		-[picture: figure 3]
		- BUT: lack of discriminating terms in dataset
		
Classification
	- [Büsra...your turn :)]
		
Conclusion
	- An Exploration of Mood Classification in the Million Songs Dataset is a new paper (published June 2015)
	- replicable (open dataset, open source code...)
	- lack in dataset: lack of discriminatin terms
	- highly related to Information Retrieval
